A recursive function is the most straight forward way to solve this problem.
I used a DFS function to list out all the possible values of tank 1.
Then I put all the values of tank 1 into a set to rule out all the duplicate values.
Lastly, I counted the nuber of values in the set and printed out the number.

The Depth-First-Search(DFS) algorithm is a recursive algorithm.
It goes ahead and exhausitvly searches every possible nodes first, and then backtracks one level to find other possible nodes.

What was wrong with the old code was the fact that after the code ran for a while, it would deplete the list from list 1 and an error would occur.
What the code was missing was the fact that I didn't put the numbers back to the list when it moved on to the next possibility.
